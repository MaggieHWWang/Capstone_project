2. 3rd Party Segmentation 
3. Customer Journey design 

Flow: 
What are the features 
EDA - Analysis - what are the important features / relationship 
Try more model XGBoost, svm, compare 4 models - use accuracy - True negative, etc.
potential if have time: Combine model 
Evaluation on 4 models 
Conclusion & Application (plot propensity graph)  
Feature importance - rating which one has higher / lower - what are potentially other features that should be included 
What are the insights (supplement)
